Sonaural is an audiovisual collaboration between Jim Colby and DC-based artist Patrick Cain. The project explores the clashing geographic narratives
contained with the city of Tucson, AZ, via it's soundscape. Field recordings made throughout that are spliced, reassembled, and digitally manipulated into
musical compositions. Video footage made in the same locales serve as granular jumping-off points for Patrick Cain's heavily abstracted graphic
interpretation of the sound and visual narrative of the city. The full recordings were released as a small cassette run by Topaz
Records. Available <a href="https://cairocollection.bandcamp.com/album/sonaural"> here</a>.
